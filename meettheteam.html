									<h2>Ann Jordan</h2>
									<p>
										I’m delighted you’re on this website, because even though
										you are probably struggling with different parts of your
										life right now, you’re here because you’re looking for
										something to change, and you’re looking for a therapist to
										help you with these changes.
									</p>
									<p>
										I am a fully accredited Counsellor and Psychotherapist with
										the Irish Association of Humanistic and Integrative
										Psychotherapists (IAHIP) and the Addiction Counsellors of
										Ireland (ACI).
									</p>
									<p>
										I am an experienced facilitator of Smart Recovery addiction
										recovery groups and of AFINET’s 5 Step Family Support
										Programme, for those affected by addiction.
									</p>
									<p>
										I am a sessional therapist with AHR Employee Assistance
										Programme, and I am an affiliated counsellor with Dunlewey
										Addiction Service.
									</p>
									<p>
										I work with people one-to-one or in groups, both
										face-to-face and online.
									</p>

									<!-- <strong>My Approach</strong><br /> -->
									<p>
										Carolyn Spring (2019) puts it that “people come to therapy,
										when they’ve experienced a wound, a relational trauma, that
										has been been perpetrated or caused by another human being.
										And so people need to have a reparative experience, an
										opposite experience, where instead of hurt and harm and
										abuse, people experience care and compassion and empathy.
										That then has the potential to change the way they view
										other people, themselves, and the nature of the world”.
									</p>
									<p>
										The aim of my Psychotherapy and Counselling work is to allow
										you to deepen awareness of yourself without judgement and
										with compassionate curiosity.
									</p>
									<p>
										I centre this therapeutic work around the relational
										experiences between us in the therapy session, whilst also
										using your experience of yourself, your relationships and
										the environment around you. I encourage you to develop an
										open curiosity for how you are in therapy and in the world
										around you.

									<h2>Mary Malone</h2>
									<p>
										My name is Mary, and I am a fully accredited
										psychotherapist, counsellor, and pet grief coach. I
										specialize as a Humanistic Integrated Psychotherapist,
										working collaboratively with clients to help them realize
										their true potential, abilities, and unique qualities.
									</p>
									<p>
										I bring a wealth of experience to my practice. I volunteered
										with St. Vincent de Paul (S.V.P.) for seven years and with
										Foróige for nine years. I also trained as a facilitator with
										the Social Health Education Project, where I led groups in
										personal development, stress management, and communication.
										Additionally, I have facilitated aftercare groups for
										families coping with addiction, recovery, and relapse, and I
										provided counseling to individuals in addiction treatment
										centers.
									</p>

									<!-- <strong>My Approach</strong> <br /> -->
									<p>
										My aim is to provide clients with a safe, genuine,
										confidential, and accepting space that is free from
										judgment. I work at the client’s pace, ensuring they feel
										heard, seen, and supported in addressing the issues causing
										discomfort or distress in their daily lives.
									</p>
									<p>
										I have extensive experience helping clients navigate life’s
										challenges, including addiction, supporting families of
										individuals struggling with addiction, stress, anxiety,
										relationship difficulties (whether family or work-related),
										and everyday obstacles. My approach is empathetic and
										tailored to each individual, providing practical tools and
										emotional support to help them overcome these difficulties
										and move toward a more fulfilling life.
									</p>
									<p>
										I also have a deep love and respect for animals and
										understand the heartbreak of losing a beloved pet. For this
										reason, I offer a safe space to support clients through the
										grief process.
									</p>
									<p>
										I work with adults aged 18 and over, offering both
										face-to-face and online sessions.

									</p>

									<!-- <strong>My Approach</strong><br /> -->
									<p>
										I integrate different approaches depending on the needs of
										the person, however, being person-centred, authentic,
										empathic and non-judgemental is what is most important to me
										while building a therapeutic relationship.
									</p>
									<p>
										Using neuroscience and attachment as a roadmap for our inner
										experience, my aim as a therapist is to provide the
										opportunity for you to explore your inner experience,
										gaining self-awareness through self-discovery to bring a
										greater sense of well-being and quality of life—so that you
										can live a meaningful, fulfilling life, whatever that means
										for you.
									</p>
									<p>
										Whether current life challenges or old patterns are
										resurfacing, having someone to deeply listen and explore
										together in a safe and caring environment will make a
										difference in your life.
