									<p>
										I’m delighted you’re on this website, because even though
										you are probably struggling with different parts of your
										life right now, you’re here because you’re looking for
										something to change, and you’re looking for a therapist to
										help you with these changes.
									</p>
									<p>
										I am a fully accredited Counsellor and Psychotherapist with
										the Irish Association of Humanistic and Integrative
										Psychotherapists (IAHIP) and the Addiction Counsellors of
										Ireland (ACI). I am a member of the Irish Council for
										Psychotherapy (ICP) .
									</p>
									<p>
										I work as a sessional therapist with a number of
										organisations. As I am a member of ICP clients who have
										health insurance may be able to claim a portion of their
										therapy fees back, depending on their policy. Please check
										with your provider for eligibility.
									</p>
									<p>
										I work with people one-to-one or in groups, both
										face-to-face and online. I have the ability to work with
										people on a variety of different issues.
									</p>
									<p>
										Psychotherapy and Counselling allows you, with compassionate
										curiosity, to deepen awareness of yourself in relation to
										yourself and others. I centre therapeutic work around the
										relational experiences between us in the therapy session,
										whilst also using your experience of yourself, your
										relationships and the environment around you. I encourage
										you to develop an open curiosity for how you are in therapy
										and in the world around you.

									<p>
										I trained with Flatstone Institute and I am a fully
										accredited member of the Irish Association of Humanistic and
										Integrative Psychotherapists (IAHIP). I continued training
										and completed both Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) and
										Integrative Body Work.
									</p>

									<p>
										I have over 20 years’ experience working with people, from
										second chance education to life skills coach with
										individuals facing homelessness, addictions all coming from
										trauma in their early years which led me to eventually
										qualify as a psychotherapist.
									</p>

									<p>
										I integrate different approaches depending on the needs of
										the person. Being person-centred, authentic, empathic and
										non-judgemental is what is most important to me while
										building a therapeutic relationship. Using neuroscience and
										early attachments to follow our nervous system, my aim as a
										therapist is to provide the opportunity for you to explore
										your own inner experience, gain self-awareness and bring a
										greater sense of well-being to your overall lived
										experienced. I provide a safe space for your nervous system
										to slow down, your breath, body, head, thoughts, all slow
										down too.
									</p>

									<p>
										If you are experiencing any of the following, please reach
										out for support: – Abuse, Addiction, Anxiety, Depression,
										Developmental Trauma, PTSD, Stress, Self Harm, Fear,
										Rage/Aggression, Relationship Issues, Internal Confusion,
										loneliness.

									<h2>Mary Malone</h2>

									<p><strong>About Me</strong></p>
									<p>
										I am a fully accredited Psychotherapist, Counsellor and Pet
										Grief Coach. I specialise in Humanistic Integrated
										Psychotherapy, working collaboratively with clients to help
										them realise their true potential, abilities, and unique
										qualities.
									</p>

									<p>
										I bring a wealth of experience to my practice. I have many
										years of experience in Facilitating, Training, Youth Work
										and Volunteerism. I facilitated and trained groups in
										personal development, stress management, assertive
										communication and community empowerment work with the Social
										and Health Education Project. I also facilitated aftercare
										groups for families coping with addiction, along with
										providing one-to-one counselling with individuals in
										addiction treatment centres.
									</p>

									<p>
										I also have a deep love and respect for animals. I
										understand the heartbreak of losing a beloved pet. For this
										reason, I offer a safe therapeutic space to support clients
										through the grief process of losing their beloved pet.
									</p>

									<p><strong>Approach</strong></p>
									<p>
										My aim is to provide clients with a safe, genuine,
										confidential, and accepting space that is free from
										judgment. I work at the client’s pace, ensuring they feel
										heard, seen, and supported in addressing the issues causing
										discomfort and distress in their daily lives.
									</p>

									<p>
										I have extensive experience helping clients navigate life’s
										challenges, including addiction, supporting families of
										individuals struggling with addiction, stress, anxiety,
										relationship difficulties (whether family or work-related),
										and everyday obstacles. My approach is empathetic and
										tailored to each individual, providing practical tools and
										emotional support to help them overcome these difficulties
										and move toward a more fulfilling life.
									</p>

									<p>
										I have a deep love and respect for animals and understand
										the heartbreak of losing a beloved pet. For this reason, I
										offer a safe space to support clients through the grief
										process.
									</p>

									<p>
										I work with adults aged 18 and over, offering both
										face-to-face and online sessions.
									</p>

									<p><strong>Areas</strong></p>
									<p>
										Stress, anxiety, depression, addiction, families dealing
										with addiction, abuse, illness, inner child healing,
										developmental trauma, relationship difficulties (family,
										personal, work related), grief (both human and pet), along
										with difficulties that may arise from everyday life.
									</p>

									<p>
										I work with adults aged 18+, offering face-to-face sessions
										in my office in Cork, online via Zoom, along with group
										sessions.
