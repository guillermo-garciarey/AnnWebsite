									<p>
										I’m delighted you’re on this website, because even though
										you are probably struggling with different parts of your
										life right now, you’re here because you’re looking for
										something to change, and you’re looking for a therapist to
										help you with these changes.
									</p>
									<p>
										I am a fully accredited Counsellor and Psychotherapist with
										the Irish Association of Humanistic and Integrative
										Psychotherapists (IAHIP) and the Addiction Counsellors of
										Ireland (ACI).
									</p>
									<p>
										I am an experienced facilitator of Smart Recovery addiction
										recovery groups and of AFINET’s 5 Step Family Support
										Programme, for those affected by addiction.
									</p>
									<p>
										I am a sessional therapist with AHR Employee Assistance
										Programme, and I am an affiliated counsellor with Dunlewey
										Addiction Service.
									</p>
									<p>
										I work with people one-to-one or in groups, both
										face-to-face and online.
									</p>

									<!-- <strong>My Approach</strong><br /> -->
									<p>
										Carolyn Spring (2019) puts it that “people come to therapy,
										when they’ve experienced a wound, a relational trauma, that
										has been been perpetrated or caused by another human being.
										And so people need to have a reparative experience, an
										opposite experience, where instead of hurt and harm and
										abuse, people experience care and compassion and empathy.
										That then has the potential to change the way they view
										other people, themselves, and the nature of the world”.
									</p>
									<p>
										The aim of my Psychotherapy and Counselling work is to allow
										you to deepen awareness of yourself without judgement and
										with compassionate curiosity.
									</p>
									<p>
										I centre this therapeutic work around the relational
										experiences between us in the therapy session, whilst also
										using your experience of yourself, your relationships and
										the environment around you. I encourage you to develop an
										open curiosity for how you are in therapy and in the world
										around you.

									<h2>Mary Malone</h2>
									<p><strong>About Me</strong></p>
									<p>
										I am a fully accredited humanistic integrative
										psychotherapist trained with Flatstones Institute in 2017.
										Pet Grief Coach / Counsellor. Certified in inner child
										healing work, personal development, facilitation skills,
										integrated specialised tutor trainer, social awareness and
										community empowerment work.
									</p>

									<p>
										I am an experienced facilitator with the Social and Health
										Education Project, where I have led groups in personal
										development, stress management, assertive communication and
										community empowerment work. I am also an experienced
										facilitator with aftercare groups for families coping with
										addiction, along with providing one-to-one counseling with
										individuals in addiction treatment centres.
									</p>

									<p>
										I also have a deep love and respect for animals. I
										understand the heartbreak of losing a beloved pet. For this
										reason I also offer a safe space to support clients through
										the grief process of losing their beloved pet.
									</p>

									<p><strong>Approach</strong></p>
									<p>
										My aim is to provide clients with a safe, compassionate and
										accepting space that is free from judgment and fully
										confidential. In my work, I use different psychotherapy
										approaches depending on the needs of the client. I work at
										the client’s pace, ensuring they feel seen, heard and
										supported in addressing the issues that may be arising in
										their lives. I aim to ensure we are working together towards
										building the therapeutic relationship. In my work, I focus
										on providing practical tools and emotional support for those
										difficult times and helping clients to move forward to a
										more fulfilling life.
									</p>

									<p><strong>Areas</strong></p>
									<p>
										Stress, anxiety, depression, addiction, families dealing
										with addiction, abuse, illness, inner child healing,
										developmental trauma, relationship difficulties (family,
										personal, work related), grief (both human and pet), along
										with difficulties that may arise from everyday life.
									</p>

									<p>
										I work with adults aged 18+, offering face-to-face sessions
										in my office in Cork, online via Zoom, along with group
										sessions.

									<h2>Marie Scully</h2>
									<p>
										Trained with Flatstone Institute and a member of the Irish
										Association of Humanistic and Integrative Psychotherapists
										(IAHIP). I also have completed training in Rational Emotive
										Behavioural Therapy (REBT) and Integrative Body Work. I have
										over 20 years’ experience working with people, from tutor in
										second chance education to life skills coach with
										individuals facing homelessness, eventually qualifying as a
										psychotherapist in 2021.
									</p>

									<p>
										I integrate different approaches depending on the needs of
										the person; however, being person-centred, authentic,
										empathic and non-judgemental is what is most important to me
										while building a therapeutic relationship.
									</p>

									<p>
										Using neuroscience and attachment as a roadmap for our inner
										experience, my aim as a therapist is to provide the
										opportunity for you to explore your inner experience, gain
										self-awareness through self-discovery to bring a greater
										sense of well-being leading to a more fulfilling quality of
										life.
									</p>

									<p>
										Whether current life challenges or old patterns re-surfacing
										again, having someone to deeply listen and explore together
										in a safe and caring environment will make a difference in
										your life.
